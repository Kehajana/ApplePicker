# Apple Picker

**A Game Design and Development Project**

Apple Picker is an game created in Unity for my Game Design and Development class. The objective is to catch as many apples as possible before they hit the ground.

The game is inspired by the classic game, *Kaboom!*, which features similar falling-object mechanics and a focus on quick reflexes.

## How to Play

* Use the mouse to control the basket at the bottom of the screen.
* Move the basket left and right to catch the falling apples.
* Each apple you catch increases your score.
* For every apple you miss, you lose a life.
* The game resets when you run out of lives. Try to beat the High Score!
